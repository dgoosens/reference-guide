# State-Stored Aggregate

This chapter will cover the basics on how to implement an [Aggregate](../modelling-1.md#aggregates). For more details on what an Aggregate is read the [DDD and CQRS concepts](../modelling-1.md#ddd-and-cqrs-concepts) page.

### State-Stored Aggregate

An Aggregate is a regular object, which contains state and methods to alter that state. It can be described as Entity, which carry set of behaviours.   
When creating the Aggregate object, you are creating the _Aggregate Root_. 

```php
 #[Aggregate] // 1
class Product
{
    #[AggregateIdentifier] // 2
    private string $productId;

    private string $name;

    private integer $priceAmount;
    
    private function __construct(string $orderId, string $name, int $priceAmount)
    {
        $this->productId = $orderId;
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->priceAmount = $priceAmount;
    }

    #[CommandHandler]  //3
    public static function register(RegisterProductCommand $command) : self
    {
        return new self(
            $command->getProductId(),
            $command->getName(),
            $command->getPriceAmount()
        );
    }
    
    #[CommandHandler] // 4
    public function changePrice(ChangePriceCommand $command) : void
    {
        $this->priceAmount = $command->getPriceAmount();
    }
}
```

1. `Aggregate` tells Ecotone, that this class should be registered as Aggregate Root.
2. `AggregateIdentifier` is the external reference point Aggregate. 

   This field tells Ecotone to which Aggregate a given Command is targeted.

3. `CommandHandler` defined on static method acts as _factory method_. Given command it should return _new instance_ of specific aggregate, in that case new Product.
4. `CommandHandler` defined on non static class method is place where you would put business logic and state changes
